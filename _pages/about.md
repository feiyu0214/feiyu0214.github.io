ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Feiyu Zhu!
======
I am a first year CS Ph.D. student at University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Viktor Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). My research interests are lie in the symbiosis between Large Language Models and Graph Learning. 

Before that, I got my B.Eng. degree from [College of Artificial Intelligence](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/) in Xi'an Jiaotong University. I had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Guanglei Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dpcpsXQAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Xuetao Zhang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/xuetaozh) and [Prof. Longjun Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/liulongjun/english-version) in my undergraduate years.
